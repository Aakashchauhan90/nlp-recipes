    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to fine tune Transformers for extractive text summarization. Utility functions and classes in the NLP Best Practices repo are used to facilitate data preprocessing, model training, model scoring, result postprocessing, and model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before You Start\n",
    "\n",
    "The running time shown in this notebook is on a Standard_NC24s_v3 Azure Ubuntu Virtual Machine with 4 NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs. \n",
    "> **Tip**: If you want to run through the notebook quickly, you can set the **`QUICK_RUN`** flag in the cell below to **`True`** to run the notebook on a small subset of the data and a smaller number of epochs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using only 1 NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs, 16GB GPU memory configuration,\n",
    "- for data preprocessing, it takes around 1 minutes to preprocess the data for quick run. Otherwise it takes ~20 minutes to finish the data preprocessing. This time estimation assumes that the chosen transformer model is \"distilbert-base-uncased\" and the sentence selection method is \"greedy\", which is the default. The preprocessing time can be significantly longer if the sentence selection method is \"combination\", which can achieve better model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- for model fine tuning, it takes around 2 minutes for quick run. Otherwise, it takes around ~3 hours to finish. This estimation assumes the chosen encoder method is \"transformer\". The model fine tuning time can be shorter if other encoder method is chosen, which may result in worse model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ROUGE Evalation**: To run rouge evaluation, please refer to the section of compute_rouge_perl in [summarization_evaluation.ipynb](./summarization_evaluation.ipynb) for setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Distributed Training**:\n",
    "Please note that the jupyter notebook only allows to use pytorch [DataParallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#dataparallel). Faster speed and larger batch size can be achieved with pytorch [DistributedDataParallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/notes/ddp.html)(DDP). Script [extractive_summarization_cnndm_distributed_train.py](./extractive_summarization_cnndm_distributed_train.py) shows an example of how to use DDP.\n",

'' here , inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they 're ready to appear in court . most often , they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer -- charges that judge steven leifman says are usually `` avoidable felonies . '' he says the arrests often result from confrontations with police . mentally ill people often wo n't do what they 're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid , delusional , and less likely to follow directions , according to leifman . so , they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed , but not getting any real help because they 're in jail . we toured the jail with leifman . he is well known in miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill . even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards , we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor . go inside the ` forgotten floor ' '' at first , it 's hard to determine where the people are . the prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes . imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that 's kind of what they look like . they 're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves . that 's also why they have no shoes , laces or mattresses . leifman says about one-third of all people in miami-dade county jails are mentally ill . so , he says , the sheer volume is overwhelming the system , and the result is what we see on the ninth floor . of course , it is a jail , so it 's not supposed to be warm and comforting , but the lights glare , the cells are tiny and it 's loud . we see two , sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes , sometimes naked , lying or sitting in their cells . `` i am the son of the president . you need to get me out of here !

    "Although they advised that details could change before the announcement, administration officials said the measure was needed to avert what they fear could be a systemwide outbreak of the coronavirus inside detention facilities along the border.

    "The Trump administration plans to immediately turn back all asylum seekers and other foreigners attempting to enter the United States from Mexico illegally, saying the nation cannot risk allowing the coronavirus to spread through detention facilities and Border Patrol agents, four administration officials said.\n",
    "The administration officials said the ports of entry would remain open to American citizens, green-card holders and foreigners with proper documentation. Some foreigners would be blocked, including Europeans currently subject to earlier travel restrictions imposed by the administration. The points of entry will also be open to commercial traffic.\"\"\""
